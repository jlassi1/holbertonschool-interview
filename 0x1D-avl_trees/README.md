# 0x1D-avl_trees

## Tasks
0. Is AVL


    Write a function that checks if a binary tree is a valid AVL Tree

        Prototype: int binary_tree_is_avl(const binary_tree_t *tree);
        Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to check
        Your function must return 1 if tree is a valid AVL Tree, and 0 otherwise
        If tree is NULL, return 0

    Properties of an AVL Tree:

        An AVL Tree is a BST
        The difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one
        The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree
